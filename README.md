# RTE
RichText editor for VFP9 applications based on shell.explorer.2

This is version 1.0 Beta

The possibilities of this RichTextEditor (RTE) are similar to those of e.g. MS Word, but of course there are less options. It is the result of my research to offer the users of my VFP9 applications advanced editing options, like Underline, Italic, Bold, Undo, Redo, Insert and start embedded hyperlinks, lists, Indents, inserting pictures and drag&drop of rich-text, ingoing and outgoing.
